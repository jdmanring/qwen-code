/**
 * parse-review-stream.cjs
 *
 * Streaming JSON-Lines parser for `qwen --output-format stream-json
 * --include-partial-messages` review output.
 *
 * Filename uses .cjs (not .js) because the repo's root package.json sets
 * "type": "module"; a plain .js would be loaded as ESM and `require()`
 * would throw at runtime. We want CommonJS here to keep the script
 * runnable directly via `node` without an `import` rewrite.
 *
 * Phase 1-3 used an inline node script in the workflow yml that only kept
 * the LAST assistant text segment. That worked for the happy path but
 * meant a 50-min step timeout left no partial review on the PR (violating
 * the G3 "always-emit" goal of the preflight design).
 *
 * This parser ACCUMULATES every assistant/message text segment as it
 * encounters them in the stream, so when the qwen process is killed mid-
 * generation (timeout, OOM, SIGTERM), the on-disk markdown still contains
 * everything the model emitted up to that moment. A `⚠️ time-capped`
 * warning header can then be prepended by the caller (workflow shell)
 * before the file is posted as a PR comment.
 *
 * Design choices:
 *  - Pure stdlib (no deps): runs on the runner without extra `npm install`.
 *  - Defensive: malformed JSON lines are skipped, not fatal — partial
 *    streams (which can have a truncated final line if killed) must still
 *    produce useful output.
 *  - Empty-input safe: writes a fallback placeholder so the downstream
 *    `gh pr comment --body-file` step always has a non-empty body.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   parse-review-stream.cjs <input.jsonl> <output.md> [tier] [status]
 *
 * Args:
 *   input.jsonl   Path to the stream-json file written by `qwen ... | tee`.
 *   output.md     Path to write the accumulated review markdown to.
 *   tier          Optional tier label (UL/LIGHT/STANDARD/DEEP), embedded
 *                 in a HTML comment header. Used by maintainers to filter
 *                 review comments by tier in retrospective analysis.
 *   status        Optional status label, expected values: 'complete' or
 *                 'timeout'. Embedded in the same header.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  success (file written, even with placeholder body)
 *   1  IO error reading input
 *   2  bad arguments
